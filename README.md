# üñ•Ô∏è C Workshop Assignments Repository

Welcome to my C Workshop Assignments repository! I'm a college student who is passionate about programming, and I've created this public repository to share the C assignments I've been working on during my course. These assignments cover various aspects of C and are designed to help fellow students like you improve your coding skills.

## üìÇ What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find a collection of C programming assignments and my solutions for them. These assignments were part of my C Workshop course, and they span a range of topics and difficulty levels, from basic concepts to more advanced projects.

Here's a glimpse of what you can explore:

- **üõ†Ô∏è Workshop Assignments:** These assignments are designed to help you grasp fundamental C programming concepts. You'll find solutions that demonstrate my understanding of topics like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

- **üöÄ Final Project Milestones:** As part of the course, I worked on a final project broken down into multiple milestones. Each milestone represents a significant step in the development of a complete application using C. You can review my project's progress and see how I tackled complex challenges.

## üìú Marks Secured

Here are the marks I secured for each workshop assignment:

## üîç Using the Repository

This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and reference. You can explore the code I've written for various assignments to gain insights into C programming techniques. However, it's important to remember that while reference is encouraged, direct copying without comprehension is discouraged. Use these solutions as learning aids to improve your coding skills.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The content provided in this repository is intended for educational and informational purposes only. The code, assignments, and project milestones shared here represent my personal work completed during my C Workshop course. While I encourage fellow students to use this repository as a source of inspiration and learning, I want to emphasize the importance of academic integrity and ethical conduct.

**üö´ Copying, reproducing, or submitting the code from this repository as your own for academic assignments is a violation of academic integrity**. It is essential to understand the concepts, principles, and coding techniques presented here and to apply them independently to your own work.

Using this repository as a reference is encouraged, but direct replication without genuine effort and comprehension not only compromises your learning experience but also undermines the principles of learning and growth that education is built upon. Proper attribution and acknowledgment are critical if you choose to integrate any concepts or ideas from this repository into your own projects or assignments.

By accessing and using the content in this repository, you acknowledge that you understand the implications of academic integrity and that you will use this material responsibly to enhance your learning journey.
